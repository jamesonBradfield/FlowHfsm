Title: HFSM Refactor: Atomic Activation & Tooling Updates

1. Core Architecture Refactor (Behavior Tree / Atomic Conditions)
   - [ ] Modify `addons/hfsm_editor/runtime/RecursiveState.gd`
       - [ ] Remove `transitions: Array[StateTransition]` export.
       - [ ] Add `activation_conditions: Array[StateCondition]` export.
       - [ ] Add `activation_mode: int` (Enum: AND=0, OR=1) to control condition logic.
       - [ ] Rename `check_transitions()` to `can_activate(actor, blackboard) -> bool`.
           - Implement logic to evaluate `activation_conditions` based on `activation_mode`.
       - [ ] Update `process_state()`:
           - Iterate children in order (Tree Order = Priority).
           - Call `child.can_activate()`.
           - Switch active child if a higher-priority child meets conditions (and current is not locked).

2. Cleanup & Deprecation
   - [ ] Delete `addons/hfsm_editor/runtime/StateTransition.gd` (Obsolete).
   - [ ] Delete `Resources/transitions/*.tres` (Cleanup old assets).

3. Tooling & Editor Updates
   - [ ] Update `addons/hfsm_editor/editor/hfsm_inspector.gd`
       - [ ] Remove custom inspector logic for Transitions.
       - [ ] Ensure `activation_conditions` are editable (Standard Array Inspector or Custom).
   - [ ] Delete `addons/hfsm_editor/editor/transition_editor.gd` (if exists and unused).

4. Game Logic & Setup Updates
   - [ ] Update `Scripts/SetupHFSM.gd`
       - [ ] Refactor code to assign conditions directly to `RecursiveState.activation_conditions`.
       - [ ] Remove `StateTransition` instantiation.
   - [ ] Update `Scripts/Tools/StateBuilder.gd`
       - [ ] Align with new API.

5. Documentation
   - [ ] Add GDScript documentation comments (`##`) to `RecursiveState`.
   - [ ] Explain the "Priority by Order" logic in class docs.
